This is made for my own learning, a lot of it is me setting up the files and UI then making ChatGPT animate it while I look everything over to learn from it.
There isn't really a major endgame here, though I hope to have achieve in the end:

A website where you can summon a whole ton of Heishou Sinclair and watch them jump around and make funny sounds. You can also throw and drag them around.

Features I may want to add once the main program is finished:

1. Allow Heishou Heathcliff to fight Heishou Sinclair
2. Add Lord of Hongyuan as an option
3. Add Wild Hunt as an option
4. Add a knife tool which kills off characters you click.
   - characters may run away from the knife
